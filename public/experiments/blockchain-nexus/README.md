- WebGL for advanced visualizations

## Getting Started

1. Include the experiment in your project:
   ```html
   <iframe src="blockchain-nexus.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
   ```

2. Interact with the blockchain:
   ```javascript
   const nexus = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.blockchainNexus;
   
   // Add a transaction
   nexus.addTransaction({
     from: 'Alice',
     to: 'Bob',
     amount: 10
   });
   
   // Start mining
   nexus.startMining();
   ```

3. Monitor blockchain state:
   ```javascript
   nexus.onBlockMined(block => {
     console.log('New block:', block);
     console.log('Chain length:', nexus.getChainLength());
   });
   ```

## Security Considerations

- This is a simulation, not for production use
- Demonstrates concepts but lacks full security measures
- Should be combined with proper cryptographic protocols
- Not suitable for real cryptocurrency implementation

## Performance Notes

- Adjustable mining difficulty
- Configurable block size
- Transaction pool limits
- Visual performance scaling
