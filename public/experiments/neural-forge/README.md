## Getting Started

1. Include the experiment in your project:
   ```html
   <iframe src="neural-forge.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
   ```

2. Generate keys programmatically:
   ```javascript
   const forge = document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.neuralForge;
   forge.generateKey({
     length: 256,
     entropy: 'high',
     type: 'asymmetric'
   }).then(key => {
     console.log('Generated key:', key);
   });
   ```

3. Monitor training progress:
   ```javascript
   forge.onTrainingProgress(progress => {
     console.log('Training loss:', progress.loss);
     console.log('Entropy:', progress.entropy);
   });
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Neural networks should not be the sole source of entropy
- Always combine with traditional cryptographic methods
- Regular retraining may be necessary for security
- Monitor for potential adversarial attacks
