World Tree is a dynamic metaverse map:

It’s a web-based multi-user interface and a server endpoint for coordinating cross-metaverse communication, mapping and travel.

Currently, virtual spaces in the Metaverse landscape are disconnected and often served to users via traditional gallery-based web2 interfaces that miss the opportunity to make space exploration feel like an adventure.

World Tree is a landscape of portals, points of interest, and features activated by users.

## Features: 
**Immersive:** Custom camera controller combines 2d and 3d navigation. 
<u></u>
**Updatable:** Map is curated and easily updatable - links and urls are embedded in 3d geometry using custom properties.

**Social:** Users are visible to each-other, broadcast via websockets. 

**Data:** Visual pings are sent for user movements, link clicks and space joins. 

**Beacons**: Users inside Mona worlds activate ‘beacons’ to send signals to the map. 

**Activity Log:** Actions inside the map are recorded in a log, generating an evolving history.

<u>Known Bugs: </u>
- Users spheres are not properly destroyed on exit.
- Beacons can be spammed.
- Console errors: (x) and (object) not found.
- Lots more

<u>Future Features: </u>
- Continued expansion and population of the cross-metaverse map as I explore. 
- Database integration for persistence - users can make mark on landscape, leave things behind.
- User Login - let users save previous experiences, share with others, and customize the map.
- Crypto-wallet integration - explore inventory and persistence possibilities.

The project is built around the idea of metaverse cartography - that the Metaverse is an unmapped space and that we as users are early explorers. The project takes inspiration from the early nautical cartography, where landmasses are represented as a combination of geometric approximation and imaginative illustration of features and potential resources.
