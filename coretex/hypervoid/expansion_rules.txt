# Expansion & Error Correction Rules

1. **Redundancy Reduction**
   - Each glyph is **contextually dependent**, minimizing repetition.
   - Compound meanings (Ψ → Σ) resolve only at **interpretation level**.

2. **Error Handling Mechanisms**
   - **Self-healing structures:** If (Q rep) is lost, infer from (Ξ(Ψ) ⊕ H(Ψ)).
   - **Fuzzy tolerance:** Minor alterations to Σ allow recovery through ML(Σ).

3. **Context-Dependent Decoding**
   - Ψ states remain **observer-relative** (Ξ affects interpretation).
   - Σ layers adapt to **dimensional transitions (L).**
