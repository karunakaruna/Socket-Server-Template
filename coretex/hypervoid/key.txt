# Encoding Key for Symbolic Compression

Base Notation:
Ψ = Encrypted User State, Context-Dependent
Σ = Aggregated Network State (Multi-Layered)
⊥ = Security-Related Structure (Encryption, Firewalls, Isolation)
∿ = Communication in Superposed or Layered Forms
Ξ = Observer-Projected Interpretations (ML-Generated)
H = Systemic Change or Event Occurrence
Q = Direct User Relationship (Links, Networks)
ML = AI-Processed Summaries
e⁻ = Action, Energy Transfer
L = Dimensional Navigation
🛠 = Meta-Level Process, System-Level Modulation

Layered Expansion:
(Ξ(Ψ)) → AI-derived user observation
(H(Ψ)) → Change in user entropy
(Ψ → ⊥ decoh) → Encrypted user transition
(Σ⊥) → Secure Aggregation of User States
(Ξ(Ψ) ⊕ H(Ψ)) ∿⊥ → Quantum Interference with Observer Shift
