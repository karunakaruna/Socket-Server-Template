# HyperVoid Server/Client Implementation

A high-performance, asynchronous WebSocket server and client implementation designed for efficient real-time communication.

## Features

- Asynchronous I/O using `asyncio`
- Efficient buffer management
- Real-time metrics tracking
- Multi-client broadcast support
- Interactive client interface
- Connection state management
- Error handling and logging

## Server Features

- Connection tracking
- Message counting
- Uptime monitoring
- Client identification
- Broadcast messaging
- Efficient memory usage

## Client Features

- Automatic reconnection
- Message callbacks
- Interactive mode
- Efficient message handling
- Connection state management

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

### Starting the Interactive Client

```bash
python client.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- asyncio
- logging

## Performance Considerations

- Uses optimal buffer sizes (8192 bytes)
- Implements efficient message broadcasting
- Maintains minimal state
- Asynchronous I/O for maximum throughput
- Memory-efficient data structures

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the meta-structure guidelines with support for:
- Parallel topic processing
- Cross-domain mappings
- Higher-order representations
- Lossless expansion capabilities
