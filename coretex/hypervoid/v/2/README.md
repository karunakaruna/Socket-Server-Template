# HyperVoid v2

This is version 2 of the HyperVoid server/client implementation, incorporating quantum-inspired features and advanced state management based on the combined rules specification.

## New Features

- **Quantum State Management (Ψ)**: Each client maintains a quantum state with unique identifiers and entropy keys
- **Wave Interaction (∿)**: Support for quantum entanglement between clients
- **Entropy Handling (H)**: Dynamic entropy updates for enhanced security
- **Observer-Based State (Ξ)**: State vector tracking and management
- **Aggregated Network State (Σ)**: Improved message handling with state awareness

## Commands

- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/users` - List connected users
- `/whisper <user> <message>` - Send private message
- `/broadcast <message>` - Send message to all users
- `/state` - View your quantum state
- `/entangle <user>` - Create quantum entanglement with another user

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

2. Start one or more clients:
```bash
python client.py
```

## State Types

- 🜁 (Ψ) - Quantum/Waveform Entity
- 🜂 (Σ) - Summation/Aggregation
- 🜄 (∿) - Wave-Like Interaction
- ⚛️ (Ξ) - Observer State
- 📡 (H) - Entropy Change

## Implementation Details

- Enhanced security through quantum-inspired state management
- Dynamic entropy pool for improved randomization
- Support for client entanglement and state observation
- Improved error handling and state recovery
- Real-time state vector updates
